The structure of the Directed Flood Routing Framework (DFRF) is the following:

The DFRF engine is implemented in the Dfrf* files. Normally you would use only 
the DfrfClientC component, which reserves memory for your packets and gives a 
convenient DfrfSend and DfrfReceive interfaces. In this case you have to set the 
routing policy you want to use.

There are several routing policies already implemented: 

1) BroadcastPolicyC gives a policy that can be used to send messages to all 
nodes in the network. You can always use this policy. 

2) The GradientPolicyC and SpanningTreePolicyC routes messages to a single route 
node. This routing tree needs to be set up, which is done by sending an 
arbitrary message with the BroadcastClientC component. With GradientPolicyC 
every node closer to the root will forward received messages, while with 
SpanningTreePolicyC only the parent will forward messages towards the root.

A typical usage would be for the root node (e.g. a BaseStation node conneted to 
a PC) to send a command message with a BroadcastClientC component. This sets up 
the convergecast routing tree. Then the receiving nodes can reply with the 
DfrfClientC component and either the GradientPolicyC or SpanningTreePolicyC.
