/**
 * This interface is designed to create a low level uniformized api for 
 * storage chips. It's mainly designed for Atmel at45db, ST m25pXX, 
 * and SD/MMC cards.
 * 
 * It's based on two units: sectors (erase unit) and page (read/write
 * unit) You can read/write whole pages only, and erase whole sectors
 * only. Sectors are usually bigger than pages.
 * Before writing a page, it MUST be erased. Although it's not checked,
 * and some hardware is rewritable and does not require this, you should
 * do this for platform independent code. It shouldn't slow down your code
 * on rewritable hardware since it's immadeiatly returns SUCCESS.
