The SI443X radio driver has the following configuration options. Some of 
these are set in the platforms/xxx/chips/si443x/RadioConfig.h header file, 
others can be set in your Makefile.

SI443X_DEF_RFPOWER:

This is the default value of the TX POWER register. This can be cahanged via the 
PacketTransmitPower interface provided by the SI443XActiveMessageC.

SI443X_BASE_FREQ_10MHZ:
SI443X_BASE_FREQ_KHZ:

The base carrier frequency is set accordint to these two values. The carrier frequency is
set to (SI443X_BASE_FREQ_10MHZ * 10000 + SI443X_BASE_FREQ_KHZ) kiloHz. Any values between
240000 kHz (240.000 MHz) and 959999 kHz (959.999 Mhz) can be given.

SI443X_CHANNEL_STEP_KHZ:

This is the spacing between channels over the frequency band. The 0th channel starts
from the preset base carrier frequency, the k'th channel starts from (base carrier frequency) +
k * SI443X_CHANNEL_STEP_KHZ. The channel spacing is defined in kHz precision, minimum 
value is 1 (1 kHz), maximum value is 2550 (2,55 Mhz).

Note that if this value is lesser than 10 kHz, the channel switching is done by manually
adjusting the carrier frequency (thus slower). In turn it provides higher accuracy.

SI443X_DEF_CHANNEL:

This is the default value of the Frequency Hopping Channel Select register
This can be cahanged via the RadioChannel interface provided by the 
SI443XActiveMessageC.

SI443X_BACKOFF_MIN
SI443X_BACKOFF_INIT
SI443X_BACKOFF_CONG

The minimum backoff time, the initial backoff time, and the cognestion backoff
time in microseconds for the random CSMA/CA algorithm. See the SI443XRadioP.nc.
