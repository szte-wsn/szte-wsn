The SI443X radio driver has the following configuration options. Some of 
these are set in the platforms/xxx/chips/si443x/RadioConfig.h header file, 
others can be set in your Makefile.

SI443X_DEF_RFPOWER:

This is the default value of the TX POWER register. This can be cahanged via the 
PacketTransmitPower interface provided by the SI443XActiveMessageC.

SI443X_BASE_FREQ_10MHZ:
SI443X_BASE_FREQ_KHZ:
SI443X_BASE_FREQ_MILLIHZ:

The base carrier frequency is set according to these two values. The carrier frequency is
set to (SI443X_BASE_FREQ_10MHZ * 10^7 + SI443X_BASE_FREQ_KHZ * 10^3 + SI443X_BASE_FREQ_MILLIHZ * 10^(-2) ) Hz.
Any values between 240000 kHz (240.000 MHz) and 959999 kHz (959.999 Mhz) can be given. For details, see the RadioConfig.h file.

SI443X_CHANNEL_STEP_KHZ:

This is the spacing between channels over the frequency band. The 0th channel starts
from the preset base carrier frequency, the k'th channel starts from (base carrier frequency) +
k * SI443X_CHANNEL_STEP_KHZ. The channel spacing is defined in kHz precision, minimum 
value is 1 (1 kHz), maximum value is 2550 (2,55 Mhz).

SI443X_MODEM_CONFIG:

The modem is configured based on precomputed register values. These values can be found in RadioConfig.h, new config values should be
inserted there. If multiple modem configuration exist, there is a possibility to choose from them using this constant.

SI443X_DEF_CHANNEL:

This is the default value of the Frequency Hopping Channel Select register
This can be cahanged via the RadioChannel interface provided by the 
SI443XActiveMessageC.

SI443X_BACKOFF_MIN
SI443X_BACKOFF_INIT
SI443X_BACKOFF_CONG

The minimum backoff time, the initial backoff time, and the cognestion backoff
time in microseconds for the random CSMA/CA algorithm. See the SI443XRadioP.nc.
